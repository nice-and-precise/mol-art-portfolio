Add these final polish improvements:

1. IMAGE LOADING STATE:
Add skeleton loaders for images - shimmer animation with warm tan (#d4c4b0 in light, #3d2f24 in dark) while images load.

2. CARD CLICK FEEDBACK:
Add active state when cards are clicked - scale to 0.98 briefly before navigation, gives tactile feedback.

3. SUBTLE BORDER ON HOVER:
Add 2px terracotta (#9c8671) border that fades in on card hover, complements the shadow lift.

4. ACCESSIBILITY IMPROVEMENTS:
- Add focus visible states (keyboard navigation) with terracotta outline
- Ensure theme toggle has proper ARIA labels
- Add "View details" screen reader text to cards

5. SMOOTH PAGE TRANSITIONS:
Add fade-in animation when page loads - all cards fade in sequentially with 100ms stagger for elegant reveal.

Keep all existing spacing, colors, and behavior. These are subtle refinements for production quality.
