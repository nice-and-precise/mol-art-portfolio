# üî© Bolt.new Strategy - Token-Efficient Workflow

**Goal**: Use Bolt.new for rapid UI prototyping, then extract code for SDD implementation

**Why Bolt.new?**
- ‚úÖ Free to use (no subscription required)
- ‚úÖ Live preview while you iterate
- ‚úÖ React + TypeScript out of the box
- ‚úÖ Export code when done
- ‚úÖ You work independently (saves Claude Code tokens)

**Key Insight**: You do the creative iteration in Bolt (independent), Claude does the production implementation (efficient).

## üìã Your Step-by-Step Guide

### Phase 1: Prototype in Bolt.new (You - Independent)

**Time estimate**: 20-30 minutes

1. **Open Bolt.new**: https://bolt.new

2. **Paste this prompt**:
```
Create a pottery gallery for a ceramic artist portfolio using React and TypeScript.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Responsive grid: 1 column (mobile), 2 (tablet), 3 (desktop)
- Each pottery card shows: image, title, techniques (badges), description
- Use these EXACT colors:
  ‚Ä¢ Background: #faf8f5
  ‚Ä¢ Card bg: #ffffff
  ‚Ä¢ Primary: #9c8671
  ‚Ä¢ Text: #3d2f24
  ‚Ä¢ Badge bg: #d4c4b0
- Typography: Georgia serif for titles, system-ui for body
- Rounded corners: 12px
- Card shadow that grows on hover
- Min font size: 16px

Use this sample data:
[
  {
    "title": "Earth Vessel",
    "techniques": ["hand-building", "slip decoration"],
    "description": "Hand-built vessel inspired by ancient earthenware forms.",
    "image": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1610701596007-11502861dcfa?w=600"
  },
  {
    "title": "Spiral Form",
    "techniques": ["wheel-throwing", "carving"],
    "description": "Wheel-thrown form with carved spiral patterns.",
    "image": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1578749556568-bc2c40e68b61?w=600"
  },
  {
    "title": "Textured Bowl",
    "techniques": ["hand-building", "pit firing"],
    "description": "Hand-built bowl with natural texture from pit firing.",
    "image": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1615485736962-3f8a6f73e7a6?w=600"
  }
]

Make it feel warm, earthy, and handcrafted.
```

3. **Iterate in Bolt**:
   - Try: "Make titles bigger and more prominent"
   - Try: "Add more whitespace between cards"
   - Try: "Make hover effect more subtle"
   - Try: "Adjust badge styling to be smaller"

4. **When satisfied**:
   - Take screenshots
   - Click "Download" or copy the code
   - Note what you love about the design

---

### Phase 2: Return to Claude Code (Efficient Handoff)

**What to bring back**:
1. ‚úÖ Screenshot of final design
2. ‚úÖ Exported code (HTML/CSS/React)
3. ‚úÖ Brief description: "I want the gallery to look like this"

**What to say** (exact message template):
```
I prototyped the gallery in Bolt.new. Here's what I want:

[Attach screenshot]

Key features I love:
- [e.g., "The card hover effect"]
- [e.g., "The technique badge styling"]
- [e.g., "The spacing between cards"]

Here's the code Bolt generated: [paste code or attach file]

Ready to create the spec and implement this properly in our Astro site.
```

**Then Claude will**:
1. Run `/specify` based on your Bolt prototype
2. Create implementation plan
3. Generate tasks
4. Write tests
5. Implement in Astro (not raw React)
6. Ensure constitutional compliance

## üé® Bolt.new Pro Tips

### Getting Better Results

**‚úÖ DO:**
- Specify exact hex colors
- Request specific spacing values (e.g., "32px gap")
- Ask for responsive breakpoints
- Iterate on one thing at a time
- Save each version you like

**‚ùå DON'T:**
- Ask for complex state management (keep it simple)
- Request backend features (Bolt is frontend only)
- Try to match our exact file structure (we'll adapt it)
- Worry about Astro compatibility (Claude handles translation)

### Common Iterations

**If colors are wrong**:
```
Use these exact hex codes:
- Background: #faf8f5
- Primary: #9c8671
- Text: #3d2f24
```

**If spacing feels cramped**:
```
Increase gap between cards to 48px and add 32px padding inside each card
```

**If it doesn't feel artisanal**:
```
Make titles Georgia serif (larger), add more whitespace, use softer shadows
```

**If layout needs work**:
```
Try a masonry layout instead of grid, or use different card heights
```

## üîÑ Code Translation Guide

**Bolt generates**: Pure React components
**We need**: Astro components with React islands

**Claude will handle**:
- ‚úÖ Convert React ‚Üí Astro `.astro` files
- ‚úÖ Identify which parts need React islands
- ‚úÖ Integrate with our content collections
- ‚úÖ Apply Tailwind classes from our config
- ‚úÖ Ensure test coverage
- ‚úÖ Follow constitutional principles

**You don't need to worry about**:
- File structure compatibility
- Astro-specific syntax
- Test implementation
- Build configuration

## üìä Token Usage Comparison

### Old Approach (High Token Usage):
```
User: "Design a gallery"
Claude: [Reads files, plans, codes, iterates] - 10K+ tokens
User: "Change the spacing"
Claude: [Re-analyzes, modifies, tests] - 5K+ tokens
User: "Try different colors"
Claude: [Iterates again] - 5K+ tokens
Total: 20K+ tokens for iterations
```

### New Approach (Low Token Usage):
```
User: [Works in Bolt independently] - 0 tokens
User: "Here's my Bolt design, implement it"
Claude: [/specify ‚Üí /plan ‚Üí implement once] - 8K tokens
Total: 8K tokens (60% savings!)
```

**Efficiency gain**: ~60% token reduction by iterating in Bolt first

## üöÄ After Bolt: SDD Implementation

When you return with Bolt code, Claude follows this streamlined process:

### 1. Specification (5 min)
```
/specify Gallery Component from Bolt.new Prototype

User Stories:
- As a visitor, I want to see pottery in a responsive grid
- As a visitor, I want to click cards to view details
- As a mobile user, I want single-column layout

Acceptance Criteria:
- Matches Bolt.new visual design
- Uses Astro content collections (not hardcoded data)
- Responsive breakpoints: 640px (tablet), 1024px (desktop)
- Passes all constitutional gates
```

### 2. Planning (5 min)
- Technology: Astro component + React island for interactions
- Data source: `src/content/pieces/*.md`
- Styling: Tailwind with clay palette
- Constitutional check: All gates pass

### 3. Tasks (auto-generated)
- Create Gallery.astro component
- Write tests for responsive behavior
- Implement grid layout
- Add hover effects
- Integrate content collections

### 4. Test-First Implementation (15 min)
- Write tests based on Bolt design
- Get approval
- Confirm RED phase
- Implement to GREEN
- Deploy

**Total time with Claude**: ~30 minutes
**Your independent Bolt time**: ~20 minutes
**Total**: ~50 minutes vs. 2+ hours of back-and-forth

## üîó Quick Links

- **Bolt.new**: https://bolt.new
- **Color Palette Reference**: [constitution.md](../constitution.md#color-palette)
- **Sample Data**: In this file above (3 pottery pieces)
- **When Done**: Return to Claude Code with screenshot + code

## üí° Why This Works

**Design Iteration** = Creative, exploratory, visual
‚Üí **Best tool**: Bolt.new (instant visual feedback)

**Production Implementation** = Structured, tested, integrated
‚Üí **Best tool**: Claude Code + SDD methodology

**By separating concerns**, we:
1. ‚úÖ Reduce token usage (you iterate independently)
2. ‚úÖ Get better design (visual tool for visual work)
3. ‚úÖ Maintain quality (SDD for production code)
4. ‚úÖ Save time (parallel workflows)
5. ‚úÖ Follow constitution (Claude enforces gates)

---

## üöÄ Ready to Start?

1. Open: https://bolt.new
2. Copy the prompt from "Phase 1" above
3. Paste and iterate until you love it
4. Come back with: screenshot + code + "implement this"

**Estimated timeline**:
- You in Bolt: 20-30 min
- Back to Claude: 5 min handoff
- Claude implements: 25-30 min
- **Total: ~1 hour to production gallery** ‚ú®

Take your time in Bolt - this is the creative part! When you're done, we'll make it production-ready using SDD.
