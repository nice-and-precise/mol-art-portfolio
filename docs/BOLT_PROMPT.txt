Build a pottery gallery component for a ceramic artist portfolio.

VISUAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Responsive grid layout: 1 column (mobile <640px), 2 columns (tablet 640-1024px), 3 columns (desktop >1024px)
- Each pottery card contains: square image (1:1 aspect ratio, 100% width), title (Georgia serif, 1.75rem, bold), techniques as small rounded pill badges, description (max 3 lines with ellipsis overflow)
- Cards have 12px rounded corners, white background, subtle shadow (0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1))
- On hover: shadow grows to (0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.15)) and card scales to 1.02 with 300ms smooth transition
- Grid gap: 32px between cards
- Card internal padding: 24px

COLOR PALETTE (use exactly these hex values):
- Page background: #faf8f5 (warm cream)
- Card background: #ffffff (white)
- Title text: #3d2f24 (dark earth)

- Badge text size: 0.875rem (14px)

SPACING & DIMENSIONS:
- Container max-width: 1200px, centered with auto margins
- Top/bottom page padding: 64px
- Card aspect ratio: Image is 1:1 square, content below is natural height
- Badge padding: 6px 12px
- Badge gap between items: 8px
- Space between image and title: 16px
- Space between title and badges: 12px
- Space between badges and description: 12px

DATA STRUCTURE (use this exact JSON):
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Earth Vessel",
    "techniques": ["hand-building", "slip decoration", "reduction firing"],
    "description": "Hand-built vessel inspired by ancient earthenware forms. Features natural clay texture with slip decoration in warm earth tones. Fired in a reduction atmosphere to create depth.",

    "title": "Spiral Form",
    "techniques": ["wheel-throwing", "carving", "glazing"],
    "description": "Wheel-thrown cylindrical form with hand-carved spiral patterns. Celadon glaze creates a smooth, glossy finish that highlights the carved texture.",

    "title": "Textured Bowl",
    "techniques": ["hand-building", "pit firing", "burnishing"],
    "description": "Hand-built bowl with natural texture from pit firing process. Unique color variations and organic crackle patterns created by smoke and flame contact.",

AESTHETIC GOALS:
- Warm, earthy, handcrafted feel (like touching clay)
- Generous whitespace - pottery needs room to breathe
- Soft shadows, not harsh geometric ones
- Color harmony across all browns/creams (no cool grays or blues)
- Professional but artisanal, not corporate
- Images should dominate, text should support

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Use React with TypeScript
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling (configure custom colors if needed)
- Make images responsive with object-fit: cover
- Ensure accessibility: alt text for images, semantic HTML, ARIA labels where helpful
- Use CSS Grid for layout
- Implement smooth transitions (transition-all duration-300)

BEHAVIOR:
- Cards are clickable (whole card is interactive)
- Hover state is obvious but subtle (lift + shadow growth)
- Images load with good performance (use proper image sizing)
- Layout reflows smoothly on window resize
- Touch-friendly on mobile (adequate tap targets)

OUTPUT:
Create a complete, production-ready component that I can copy directly into my codebase. Make it feel like a handcrafted pottery gallery - warm, tactile, and artisanal.
