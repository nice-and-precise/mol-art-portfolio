PROJECT: Mol_Art Pottery Portfolio Gallery Component

MISSION: Create a warm, earthy, handcrafted pottery gallery for a high school ceramic artist's portfolio website.

DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
- Warm earthy aesthetic inspired by clay and ceramic glazes
- Generous whitespace - pottery needs room to breathe
- Artisanal feel, not corporate - think artist studio, not tech startup
- Accessibility-first - high schooler will maintain this independently
- Mobile-first responsive design

MANDATORY COLOR PALETTE (use exactly these hex values):
- Page background: #faf8f5 (warm cream)
- Card background: #ffffff (white)
- Title text: #3d2f24 (dark earth brown)
- Body text: #6b5544 (fired clay brown)
- Primary accent: #9c8671 (terracotta)
- Badge background: #d4c4b0 (warm tan)
- Badge text: #3d2f24 (dark earth)
- Secondary accents: #7fa5a3 (celadon blue), #8b9d83 (sage green)

DO NOT USE: Cool grays, blues (except celadon accent), blacks (#000000), or stark whites for text. All colors must be warm earth tones.

TYPOGRAPHY REQUIREMENTS:
- All titles/headings: Georgia, serif (artisanal feel)
- Body text: system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif
- Minimum font size anywhere: 16px (accessibility requirement)
- Title size: 1.75rem minimum (28px)

LAYOUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Responsive grid: 1 column mobile (<640px), 2 columns tablet (640-1024px), 3 columns desktop (>1024px)
- Grid gap: 32px minimum between cards
- Card padding: 24px internal padding
- Container max-width: 1200px, centered
- Generous top/bottom page padding: 64px minimum

COMPONENT REQUIREMENTS:
- Each pottery card must include: square image (1:1 aspect ratio), title in Georgia serif, techniques as small rounded pill badges, description text (max 3 lines with ellipsis)
- Cards must have rounded corners (12px), subtle shadows that grow on hover
- Hover effect: shadow grows, card scales to 1.02, smooth 300ms transition
- All cards are fully clickable/tappable
- Images use object-fit: cover for consistent sizing

TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- Use React with TypeScript
- Use Tailwind CSS (configure custom colors if needed)
- Semantic HTML with proper accessibility (alt text, ARIA labels)
- Touch-friendly tap targets on mobile
- Smooth responsive behavior on window resize

AESTHETIC GOALS:
- Should feel like browsing pottery in an artist's studio
- Warm, tactile, inviting - not cold or corporate
- Professional quality but handcrafted charm
- Color harmony across all browns/creams/earth tones
- Soft shadows, organic feel, generous spacing

OUTPUT EXPECTATIONS:
- Production-ready code that can be copied directly
- Clean, well-structured components
- Proper TypeScript types
- Tailwind classes for all styling
- Responsive behavior built-in
- No unnecessary dependencies

AVOID:
- Cookie-cutter corporate designs
- Cool color temperatures (grays, blues except celadon)
- Tight spacing or cramped layouts
- Harsh geometric shadows
- Sans-serif headings (must use Georgia serif)
- Complex state management (keep it simple)
- Animations beyond simple hover transitions
