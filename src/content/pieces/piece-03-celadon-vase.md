## Story Behind the Piece

Inspired by traditional Song Dynasty pottery, this celadon vase represents my attempt to master one of the most challenging glaze techniques in ceramics. The subtle jade color is achieved through precise control of iron oxide in a reduction atmosphere.

## Process Notes

- Wheel-thrown with smooth porcelain clay
- Bisque fired to cone 04
- Celadon glaze with 2% iron oxide
- Reduction fired to cone 10 (2345Â°F)
- Slow cooling for crystal development
- Total creation time: 3 weeks
