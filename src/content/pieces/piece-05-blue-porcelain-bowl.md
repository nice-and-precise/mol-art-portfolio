A delicate porcelain bowl featuring a stunning cobalt blue glaze that pools and breaks beautifully over the white porcelain body. The translucent quality of porcelain allows light to gently pass through the thin walls.

## The Story

Working with porcelain is both challenging and rewarding. This bowl showcases the material's inherent elegance - its whiteness, translucency, and ability to hold crisp details. The cobalt blue glaze creates a classic contrast that has captivated potters for centuries.

## Process Notes

- **Clay Body**: Translucent porcelain
- **Throwing**: Ultra-thin walls (3mm) requiring precise control
- **Trimming**: Delicate foot ring, revealing porcelain's white body
- **Glaze Application**: Cobalt blue dipped to achieve flowing effects
- **Firing**: Cone 10 oxidation (2350Â°F)
- **Challenge**: Preventing warping during high-fire porcelain firing
