## Story Behind the Piece

This raku bowl represents my exploration of alternative firing techniques. The unpredictable nature of raku firing creates unique patterns that can never be exactly replicated, making each piece truly one-of-a-kind.

The dramatic color shifts from copper to black showcase the reduction atmosphere's effect on the metallic glazes.
