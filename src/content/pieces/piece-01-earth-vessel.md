## Story Behind the Piece

This vessel was created during my exploration of ancient pottery techniques.
I wanted to capture the warmth and earthiness of traditional ceramics while
bringing my own modern sensibility to the form.

The slip decoration was applied in layers, creating depth and visual interest
that changes as light moves across the surface.

## Process Notes

- Built using pinch and coil techniques
- Bisque fired to cone 04
- Slip decoration applied before glaze firing
- Reduction fired to cone 6
- Total creation time: 3 weeks
