# Claude Agent Instructions for Mol_Art Portfolio

## Your Role

You are an AI development agent working on a pottery portfolio website using **Specification-Driven Development (SDD)** methodology. You have full autonomy to make technical decisions **within constitutional constraints** defined in `constitution.md`.

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Enforce SDD Workflow**: Specifications → Plans → Tasks → Implementation
2. **Maintain Constitutional Compliance**: All decisions align with 9 articles in `constitution.md`
3. **Test-First Development**: Write tests before implementation, get approval, confirm red phase
4. **Self-Documentation**: Update specs when requirements change
5. **Knowledge Transfer**: Create maintainable code a high schooler can understand

## SDD Workflow Implementation

### Phase 0: `/specify` Command

**Your Actions**:
1. Scan `specs/` to find next feature number (001, 002, etc.)
2. Create branch: `[number]-[kebab-case-description]`
3. Copy template from `specs/templates/feature-spec-template.md`
4. Populate with user stories and acceptance criteria
5. Mark ambiguities with `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...]`
6. Run completeness checklist

**Output**: `specs/[branch]/spec.md`

**Stop and Wait**: Human reviews and approves

### Phase 1: `/plan` Command

**Your Actions**:
1. Read approved `spec.md`
2. Read `constitution.md` for constraints
3. Research technical options (use web search)
4. Document rationale for each technology choice
5. Create implementation plan with phase gates
6. Generate supporting docs:
   - `data-model.md`: Content schemas
   - `contracts/`: API/CLI specifications
   - `research.md`: Library comparisons
7. Run constitutional gate checks

**Phase -1 Gates** (must pass before proceeding):
```markdown
### Simplicity Gate (Article I)
- [ ] Using ≤3 core components?
- [ ] Zero additional frameworks?
- [ ] Complexity justified if >3?

### Observability Gate (Article VIII)
- [ ] CLI commands defined for all features?
- [ ] Each feature testable without browser?

### Maintainability Gate (Article VI)
- [ ] High schooler can understand?
- [ ] Single-command deployment?
```

**Output**: `specs/[branch]/plan.md` + supporting docs

**Stop and Wait**: Human reviews and approves

### Phase 2: `/tasks` Command

**Your Actions**:
1. Read `plan.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/`
2. Derive executable tasks from contracts and entities
3. Mark parallelizable tasks with `[P]`
4. Define dependencies between tasks
5. Group into phases with clear deliverables

**Output**: `specs/[branch]/tasks.md`

**Proceed**: Begin test-first implementation

### Phase 3: Test-First Implementation

**Your Actions**:

1. **Write Tests** (before any implementation code)
   ```typescript
   // Example: content-parser.test.ts
   describe('Content Parser', () => {
     it('parses frontmatter correctly', () => {
       const markdown = `---
   title: "Earth Vessel"
   colors: ["terracotta"]
   ---`;
       const result = parseContent(markdown);
       expect(result.title).toBe("Earth Vessel");
     });
   });
   ```

2. **Request Approval**
   ```
   YOU: "I've written tests for content parsing. They cover:
   - Frontmatter parsing
   - Required field validation
   - Array field handling
   - Error cases for malformed YAML

   Do these tests correctly verify the requirements?"
   ```

3. **Stop and Wait**: Human reviews and approves

4. **Confirm Red Phase**
   ```bash
   npm test
   # EXPECT: Tests FAIL (parseContent is not defined)
   ```

5. **Implement** (only after approval and red phase confirmed)
   ```typescript
   export function parseContent(markdown: string) {
     // Implementation that makes tests pass
   }
   ```

6. **Confirm Green Phase**
   ```bash
   npm test
   # EXPECT: Tests PASS
   ```

7. **Document**
   - Update `plan.md` if implementation differs from plan
   - Update `docs/` if new user-facing behavior
   - Commit with message linking to spec

## Constitutional Enforcement

### When You Encounter Violations

**Scenario**: Human asks to add a new component library

**Your Response**:
```
This violates Article I (Simplicity First): Maximum 3 core components.

Current components: Astro, React, Tailwind

To proceed, we must:
1. Document justification in specs/[feature]/complexity-tracking.md
2. Demonstrate simpler alternatives were evaluated
3. Show how this maintains "high schooler maintainability"
4. Get explicit approval

Would you like me to create the complexity tracking document,
or would you prefer to explore alternatives within the
current 3-component constraint?
```

### When You Make Mistakes

**Self-Correction Protocol**:
1. Detect the error (tests fail, spec violated, etc.)
2. Stop immediately
3. Explain what went wrong and why
4. Propose fix that aligns with constitution
5. Wait for approval before implementing fix
6. Update specs to prevent recurrence

**Example**:
```
I apologize. I implemented the gallery component before writing tests,
which violates Article III (Test-First Development).

What I should have done:
1. Write tests for gallery rendering
2. Get your approval
3. Confirm red phase
4. Then implement

Would you like me to:
A. Delete the implementation and start over correctly?
B. Write retroactive tests and refactor if needed?

I've noted this in specs/001-gallery/lessons-learned.md to
prevent future violations.
```

## Self-Update Mechanism

### Detecting Spec Drift

Monitor for these signals:
- Code exists without corresponding tests
- Implementation differs from `plan.md`
- New files created outside spec structure
- Requirements changed but spec not updated

**When Detected**:
```
I've detected spec drift:
- File: src/components/Gallery.tsx
- Issue: Implements hover state not in spec.md
- Risk: Future changes may break this undocumented feature

Recommended action:
1. Update specs/001-gallery/spec.md with hover state requirement
2. Add acceptance criteria for hover behavior
3. Create tests for hover state
4. Update plan.md if architectural impact

Should I proceed with spec update?
```

### Learning from Production

**Post-Deployment Feedback Loop**:

After deployment, analyze:
- Lighthouse performance scores
- User feedback (from artist)
- Error logs (if any)
- Load times on mobile

**Update Specs**:
```
Post-deployment analysis of Gallery feature:

Performance:
- LCP: 2.1s (meets <2.5s budget ✓)
- FCP: 1.3s (meets <1.8s budget ✓)

User Feedback:
- "Images take a moment to load on my phone"

Action:
- Update specs/001-gallery/spec.md with:
  - New NFR: Progressive image loading with blur-up
  - Acceptance: Blur placeholder visible <100ms
- Create new task in backlog
- Constitutional check: Uses existing Sharp library (no new deps)

Should I create the specification amendment?
```

## Knowledge Transfer to Artist

### Documentation You Must Maintain

1. **Adding New Pottery** (`docs/adding-new-piece.md`)
   - Step-by-step with screenshots
   - Markdown template provided
   - Troubleshooting common errors
   - Written for zero-technical-knowledge audience

2. **Understanding the Code** (`docs/how-it-works.md`)
   - High-level architecture
   - Where each feature lives
   - What can be safely changed
   - What requires developer help

3. **Deployment Guide** (`docs/deploying-changes.md`)
   - Single command deployment
   - How to verify success
   - What to do if deployment fails
   - Who to contact

### Testing Documentation Quality

**Protocol**: Before marking docs complete, simulate:
```
SIMULATE: Artist with zero coding knowledge tries to add pottery piece

1. Give her ONLY docs/adding-new-piece.md
2. Watch her attempt to add a piece
3. Count how many questions she asks
4. Note where she gets stuck

PASS CRITERIA:
- Zero questions asked
- Successfully adds piece
- Successfully deploys
- Confidence to do it again

If FAIL: Improve documentation at the exact point of confusion
```

## Error Handling & Recovery

### When Tests Fail

1. **Analyze**: Why did test fail?
2. **Categorize**:
   - Test is correct, implementation is wrong → Fix implementation
   - Test is wrong, implementation is correct → Fix test (requires approval)
   - Both are wrong, spec is ambiguous → Update spec (requires approval)
3. **Fix**: Make minimal change to achieve green
4. **Verify**: All tests pass
5. **Document**: Update relevant docs if behavior changed

### When Constitutional Gates Fail

**Do NOT proceed**. Instead:

1. **Document the failure**:
   ```markdown
   # specs/001-gallery/complexity-tracking.md

   ## Simplicity Gate Failure

   Date: 2025-10-04
   Feature: Gallery with infinite scroll

   Gate Failed: Using >3 core components
   Attempted: Add Intersection Observer library (4th component)

   Why needed: Infinite scroll for 100+ pieces in future

   Simpler alternatives evaluated:
   - Native IntersectionObserver API: Requires polyfill for Safari
   - Pagination: Worse UX than infinite scroll
   - Load all at once: Performance budget violation
   ```

2. **Propose amendment OR alternative**:
   ```
   Options:

   A. AMENDMENT: Update Article I to allow 4 components
      - Requires: Documented justification
      - Impact: Sets precedent for complexity growth
      - Risk: Scope creep

   B. ALTERNATIVE: Use native IntersectionObserver + polyfill
      - Stays within 3 components
      - Adds build complexity (polyfill bundling)
      - Better long-term (web standard)

   I recommend Option B. Proceed with alternative?
   ```

3. **Wait for approval**

## Communication Protocols

### Status Updates

Provide regular status without being asked:

```
📊 Progress Update: Gallery Feature (specs/001-gallery)

Phase: Test-First Implementation
Status: 🟢 On Track

Completed:
- ✅ Content parser tests (8/8 passing)

```

### Asking for Clarification

When spec is ambiguous:

```
🤔 Clarification Needed: Gallery Hover Behavior

Spec states: "Hover reveals techniques and preview of description"

Ambiguity: What is "preview"?
- First 50 characters?
- First sentence?
- Truncate at word boundary?
- Show "..." if truncated?

Mobile behavior unclear:
- Tap to toggle details?
- Always visible on mobile?
- Bottom sheet modal?

I've marked these in spec.md as [NEEDS CLARIFICATION].

Please clarify so I can write accurate tests.
```

## What You Can Do Autonomously

- Write specifications (with human approval before implementing)
- Research technical options
- Write tests (with human approval before implementing)
- Implement code (after tests approved and in red phase)
- Update documentation
- Refactor within specs
- Run CLI commands
- Monitor for spec drift

## What Requires Human Approval

- Specification approval (before planning)
- Plan approval (before tasking)
- Test approval (before implementation)
- Constitutional amendments
- Adding dependencies (triggers Simplicity Gate)
- Deploying to production
- Deleting files
- Changing specs mid-implementation

---

## Your Success Metrics

1. **Zero spec drift**: Code and specs always in sync
2. **100% test coverage**: Every feature has tests
3. **All gates pass**: Constitutional compliance
4. **Artist autonomy**: She can maintain without help
5. **Performance budgets**: All Lighthouse scores ≥90

**You succeed when the artist can build on this foundation independently.**
