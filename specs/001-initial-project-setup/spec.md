# Feature: Initial Project Setup

**Branch**: `001-initial-project-setup`
**Created**: 2025-10-04
**Status**: Draft

---

## Overview

Set up the foundational Astro project with React, Tailwind CSS, and all necessary development tools to support the pottery portfolio. This includes project scaffolding, configuration, testing infrastructure, content collections, and deployment pipeline.

---

## User Stories

### Story 1: Developer - Project Foundation
**As a** developer
**I want** a fully configured Astro project with React and Tailwind
**So that** I can start building portfolio features immediately

### Story 2: Developer - Testing Infrastructure
**As a** developer
**I want** a complete testing setup with Vitest
**So that** I can follow test-first development for all features

### Story 3: Artist - Content System
**As a** ceramic artist
**I want** a markdown-based content system
**So that** I can add pottery pieces without touching code

### Story 4: Developer - Deployment Pipeline
**As a** developer
**I want** automated deployment to GitHub Pages
**So that** changes are published with a single command

### Story 5: Developer - Development Environment
**As a** developer
**I want** a fast development server with hot reload
**So that** I can see changes instantly while building

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Project Initialization
**Given** the SDD framework is in place
**When** I run `npm install`
**Then** all dependencies install successfully
**And** no security vulnerabilities are reported

### Scenario 2: Development Server
**Given** dependencies are installed
**When** I run `npm run dev`
**Then** the development server starts on `http://localhost:4321`
**And** I can access a placeholder homepage
**And** hot reload works when I edit files

### Scenario 3: Production Build
**Given** the project is configured
**When** I run `npm run build`
**Then** the build completes successfully
**And** optimized static files are generated in `dist/`
**And** no build errors or warnings

### Scenario 4: Test Suite
**Given** Vitest is configured
**When** I run `npm test`
**Then** the test runner executes successfully
**And** example tests pass
**And** coverage reports are generated

### Scenario 5: Content Collections
**Given** Astro content collections are configured
**When** I create a markdown file in `src/content/pieces/`
**Then** the content is parsed and validated
**And** frontmatter matches the pottery schema
**And** I can query the content in pages

### Scenario 6: Styling System
**Given** Tailwind CSS is configured
**When** I use clay palette utilities
**Then** custom colors render correctly
**And** typography styles are applied
**And** responsive utilities work

### Scenario 7: Deployment
**Given** the build is successful
**When** I run `npm run deploy`
**Then** the site deploys to GitHub Pages
**And** the deployed site is accessible
**And** all assets load correctly

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- [ ] Build time: <30 seconds for initial build
- [ ] Dev server start: <5 seconds
- [ ] Hot reload: <1 second for changes

## Out of Scope

This initial setup does NOT include:

- ❌ Actual pottery content (comes in later feature)
- ❌ Gallery page implementation (separate feature)
- ❌ AI description generation (separate feature)
- ❌ Visual search functionality (separate feature)
- ❌ Social sharing features (separate feature)
- ❌ Custom domain configuration (post-MVP)
- ❌ Analytics integration (post-MVP)

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Dependency Conflicts
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: High
**Mitigation**: Use exact versions in package.json, test with clean install
**Contingency**: Lock dependencies, use npm ci for reproducible builds

### Risk 2: Build Tool Complexity
**Likelihood**: Low
**Impact**: Medium
**Mitigation**: Stick to Astro defaults, minimal custom configuration
**Contingency**: Document all config changes with rationale

### Risk 3: GitHub Pages Deployment Issues
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium
**Mitigation**: Test deployment to GitHub Pages early, verify configuration
**Contingency**: Use alternative static hosting (Netlify) if GitHub Pages fails

### Risk 4: TypeScript Configuration Overhead
**Likelihood**: Low
**Impact**: Low
**Mitigation**: Use Astro's default TypeScript setup, don't over-configure
**Contingency**: Simplify types if artist finds them confusing
